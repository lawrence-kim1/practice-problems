This repository is for assorted practice JavaScript problems from various sources.

The point of solving these JavaScript problems is to focus on understanding and breaking down simple problems then use the methods I know to attempt to tackle them.

My goals from practicing these problems are to become better at problem solving and understanding the solutions completely.
