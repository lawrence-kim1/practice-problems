# practice-problems
This repository is for assorted practice JavaScript problems from various sources.

The point of solving these JavaScript problems is to focus on understanding and breaking down simple problems then use the methods I know to attempt to tackle them. Pseudocode should be included at the bottom of every solution so that I can refer back to my problem solving steps and be able to efficiently explain each line of code's purpose.

My goals from practicing these problems are to become better at problem solving and understanding the solutions completely. Some methods may not be used since they would circumvent the knowledge required to fully understand each step of the code and the solution.
